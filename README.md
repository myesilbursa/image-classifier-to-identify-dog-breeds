# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

## Project 1: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

**Summary:** Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
